The button is:

  - Shadow intensifies

**Mobile-optimized:**

## 🔗 How It Works

When someone clicks the button:
1. Browser downloads `mindstream-manifesto.pdf`
2. File saves to their Downloads folder
3. They can open, print, share, or keep it

**No tracking. No forms. No barriers.**

Just: click → download → have.

Very Mindstream.
